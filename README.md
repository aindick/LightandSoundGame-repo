# LightandSoundGame-repo
SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: [Alexis Indick]

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. W3schools, Tutorialspoint]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [I think the project was very easy since it was guided. 
I believe the hardest part was figuring out where to put everything. Testing the program was also difficult since mt internet at school is worse than at home so things took forever to start and stop.
Also, forgetting semicolons and commas was a big issue for me... ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [I don't really have an questions!]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I think I'd play around with the different sounds and try adding more buttons to make the game a bit more difficult. After each difficulty, I'd make it faster so that the game got harder to beat.]
